# todoapp-mern
This simple todo application is implemented using MERN stack.

## Back-End
The back-end side is implemented using expressJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB as its database.
Mongoose is use to help connect with the MongoDB. It helps building each model's schema.

## Front-End
The front end side is implemented using reactJS. I also used redux-toolkit to centralize
its state and api calls (this does not make sense using redux with such a small application,
though I want to do some practice using the technology).

## Technology
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Axios
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- Express
- NodeJS

## How to run the Application
- Run both sides(Front-end and Back-end)
- First cd to **back-end** folder
- Then install all dependencies by running ***npm install***
- after all dependencies are installed, start the application by running ***npm start***
- In another console, let's run the front end side
- Cd to the **client** folder
- Install all dependencies, by running ***npm install***
- after all dependencies are installed, start the application by running ***npm start***
- Enjoy playing with this small application
